This "documentation" contains 2 different folders, one intended for developers and one intended for player/tester. 

If you won't ever touch this game's code and technicalities, what you are finding is probably in the "gamedocs" folder. Otherwise, all the technical documentations are in the "developerdocs" folder. If you want to develop upon this project, or if you want to contribute to this project, please create a fork.

Thank you for your interest in this little project. Hope you have enjoyed the game, as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
