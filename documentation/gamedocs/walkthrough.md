# The Promised Neverland - walkthrough
You are a children at Ager orphanage, until one day you discovered the dark truth: This orphanage is a farm for brain-devouring demons, and all the children there are the preys. Your single objective is to survive and escape.

There are 3 ways to escape. Each will be written detailedly below.

However, in-game content contains sufficient clue to solve the game on your own. You are encouraged to try to complete the game on your own first, before resorting to this guide.

## 1. The shortest path: Wall climbing
You will be captured right away attempting to climb the wall. You must distract the demons and the Mother first.
- First, search the forest at Northwest Ager for a hidden oil can
- Second, take the lamp in Grand House (Southest Ager)
- Third, use both the lamp and the oil can at Grand House to set it on fire
- You have 5 turns before the fire is put out. Quickly use this time to grab a table cloth at Southwest Ager, then rush to Northeast Ager to use it as a rope to climb through the wall.
If you take this route, the game spans at most 7 days, which means 63 turns at most.

## 2. The less stressful path: Building a raft
This DLC will be updated in 2.0 release.

## 3. The most dramatic path: Fighting demons
And all the demons are at least 3 times your character's height, apparently.
This DLC will be updated in 3.0 release.
