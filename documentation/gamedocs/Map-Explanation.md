# Map explanation for Neverland world
The graphic is only intended to give its viewers a general overview of the game map. This file explain everything in details.

## Areas
The whole game map is contained inside the larger black circle (the "Neverland"). Its game map is divided into 3 main areas, numbered 1, 2 and 3 on the graphic map.
1. Ager: The first area where the user landed in, the Ager orphanage.
2. Valtameri: The second area, which can only accessed near end-game.
3. Pako: The third area, which is accessible if you follow the storyline.

Each of those areas are also splitted into smaller specific locations.
